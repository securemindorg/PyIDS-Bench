### This is not a script ###
### Steps to gather stats data on snort and suricata ###
### Using ps with sleep commands instead of pidstat as per James suggestion ###
### whitejs@clarkson.edu ###

# 0.) Clean up all the log files

echo " " > /var/log/suricata/stats.log && echo " " > /var/log/snort/snort.stats

# 1.) Run the following commands as a script to get the cpu, memory, date and print them to a date file and a usage file (out.1 out.2)

---
#!/bin/bash
touch out.1 out.2 && for (( i=1;i<=15;i+=1 )) ; do ps eufp $(pidof Xorg) >> out.2; sleep 1; done & 
(insert suricata / snort usage here)
---

# 1.1) For the previous command, the suricata and snort usage's are:

suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -r (pcap file)

snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -r (pcap file)

# 2.) format out.2 by getting rid of the repeated header line, removing spaces, and adding "," between each field

touch out.3 && cat out.2 | sed '1d;/^[%CPU]/d;/^$/d;s/^[ ]*//;s/[ ]\+/,/g' | cut -d, -f 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 >> out.3

# 4.) make headers for final file

touch process-suricata-stats.csv && echo "User,PID,%CPU,%MEM,VSZ,RSS,TTY,STAT,START,PID Time,Command" >> process-suricata-stats.csv
or
touch process-snort-stats.csv && echo "User,PID,%CPU,%MEM,VSZ,RSS,TTY,STAT,START,PID Time,Command" >> process-snort-stats.csv

# 5.) paste the output files together (name it for Suricata or Snort)

cat out.3 | sed 's/\t/,/g' >> process-suricata-stats.csv
or
cat out.3 | sed 's/\t/,/g' >> process-snort-stats.csv

# 6.) grab the stat files 

# 6.1) for suricata (/var/log/suricata/stats.log) clean up with the following:

cat /var/log/suricata/stats.log | grep "Date" | cut -c 21-28 > temp1.file
cat /var/log/suricata/stats.log | grep "decoder.ipv4" | cut -c 57-100 > temp2.file
echo "time,packet count" > suricata-stats.csv
paste temp1.file temp2.file | sed 's/\t/,/g' >> suricata-stats.csv

somtimes suricata will output multiple instances of the same line in the stats file, I havn't figured out why yet, just go by the timestamp and take the highest packet count per second

# 6.2) for snort (/var/log/snort.stats) clean up with the following:

echo "time, kilo-pps" > snort-stats.csv
cut -d, -f 1,5 /var/log/snort/snort.stats | sed '1d;/^[#]/d;/^$/d;s/^[ ]*//;s/[ ]\+/,/g' >> snort-stats.csv

# 7.) quick calculations in spreadsheet (Excel, OO, Google Docs) 

for suricata-stats.csv take the packet count each second and subtract it from the next. This gives you packets per second, "you'll need to make a new column"

for both suricata and snort you'll need to match up the process-(suricata/snort)-stats.csv's with the (suricarta/snort)-stats.csv's based on time stamps line by line. I could probably write another one-liner but doing it by hand is just as easy

for snort: http://trojanedbinaries.com/blog/?p=24 and second 2.2.5 of http://manual.snort.org/node16.html gives the break down of feilds 

# 8.) cleanup

rm -f out*
rm -f temp1.file temp2.file
